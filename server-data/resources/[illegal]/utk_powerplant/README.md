# utk_powerplant

Installation:

1- add items to database (items.sql)

2- drag and drop the utk_powerplant to your resources folder

3- run it on your server console or write start utk_powerplant in server.cfg

Configuration:

You can set blackout duration in server.lua line 3: "blackoutdur"

You can set cooldown in server.lua line4: "cooldown"


IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are using vMenu or any other resource like it which controls light states in the game, blackout will not work, because vMenu keeps lights states always on.
